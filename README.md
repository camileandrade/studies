<h2>👋 Welcome to my Programming Studies Repository!</h2>
<h4>📂 Dedicated to detailed documentation and tracking of my technology studies.</h4>
<h3>🌐 Technological Diversity</h3>
<p>This repository covers a wide spectrum of technologies, including programming languages, databases, frameworks, web technologies, DevOps, and much more. I document my learning journey, from basic concepts to advanced topics.</p>

<h3>📝 Notes and Code Examples</h3>
<p>I provide detailed notes and code examples in each language to illustrate the use and implementation of technologies, facilitating understanding and application. The notes are written in my native language, Portuguese, to facilitate my learning.</p>

<h3>🚀 Projects</h3>
<p>In addition to studying theoretically, I share projects I created in other repositories on my profile, applying the knowledge acquired on my journey.</p>
